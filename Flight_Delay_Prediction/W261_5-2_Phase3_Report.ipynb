    "# Project Abstract\n",
    "In the commercial aviation industry, flight delays contribute to frustration and loss of productivity. According to AirHelp, a passenger rights organization, passengers paid an average of $383 extra due to flight delays. AirHelp also estimates an approximately $30 to 34 billion impact to GDP due to flight delays\\\\({^1}{^,}{^2}{^,}{^3}\\\\). The purpose of this project is to help the executives in the aviation industry enhance the customer experience by developing a model that determines if a flight will be delayed by 15 minutes using weather, flight, and airport data spanning 2015 through 2019. The flights and airport data was provided by the Department of Transportation and contains 31 million rows with 107 features. Weather data consists of hourly reading conditions on range of weather variables as provided by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). A Departure Delay is defined as a flight departure 15 minutes or more from the scheduled departure. While the emphasis of Phase 2 was to explore the data, engineer features, and develop a baseline logistic regression model, Phase 3 focused on experimenting with multiple machine learning algorithms and scaling up our efforts to handle 5 years of data. The F1 score is the primary metric to assess success because this is a metric that gives us a better indication of the ratio of Precision and Recall in such cases when the dataset is imbalanced. In this case, we have a 4:1 ratio of On-Time flights to Delayed flights. The baseline results during Phase 2 provide an F1 score of 28.0% in classifying flights as delayed or not delayed. In Phase 3, we experimented with XGBoost, Random Forest, Multi-Layer Perceptron Neural Networks, and Gradient-boosted Trees. The best model to predict delays against the blind dataset is the Gradient-boosted tree which achieved an F1 score of 0.418, Recall of 0.655, and Precision of 0.307. Lastly, we provide a Gap Analysis of the best pipeline addressing areas where we did not meet expectations as well as areas for improvement.\n"

For the sake of the explanatory variable analysis, however, we included the type of delays as part of our pair-based visualization of the input and output features. Furthermore, we remove the null values in the DEP_DEL15 column as this is our target variable and the null values represent canceled flights.

It is valuable to note that as the days progress, the rate of delay increases from 10% flight delays in the morning to 24.66% percent of flights delayed in the evening and night. This makes sense as we would expect the airports to become increasingly busier as the days progress.

However, it is also the top 4th carreir with highest delays ratios. The Carrier F9, B6 are less preferred carriers with low number of total flights and high number of delays.

    "In order to avoid leakage we ensured that for any given moment in time, our decisions and processes are based only on information that was available before that moment. For instance, if we wanted to include as a feature the proportion of flights which were delayed leaving each airport, it would create leakage to group across all of the data. Delays from the test set would be included, which means that future information about the pattern at each airport is available before it happened. To avoid this, for our features which require data for other rows, we window according to the departure time and only ever include information from flights which occur at least two hours prior to the scheduled departure. We also make sure that our imputation and scaling is only based on values obtainable in the training folds, applying scalers and imputers trained on the most recently training fold. By controlling the flow of information in this way, we avoid committing any of the cardinal sins of machine learning, which would taint our results and create the illusion of a model which would generalize better to unseen data than it actually would."

    "#### Stages Explained\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature Engineering: <br>\n",
    "During the feature engineering stage we generate all of our derived features (seen in table below). All windowing is done by looking at least 2 hours back along our UNIX and UTC timestamp column to prevent any leakage. All other features are derived from data in the row of the flight of concern and are based on datapoints available at least 2 hours prior to scheduled departure. Given that the feature engineering takes a bulk of the runtime, we checkpoint immediately after feature engineering is finished.\n",
    "\n",
    "Blocking Time Series Splits and Undersampling: <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "After withholding the blind test set, we then split the data into 5 equally sized train/validation folds. Each validation fold is taken from the time immediately after the training data for the fold. Validation sets overlap with the next train set, excepting the last fold, where the validation data is not present in any of the training data. The training data is then undersampled for the no delay case to balance the data before training. The blind validation data is the first month of the last year in the data and the blind test data is the remaining eleven months of the final year. We undersample the training data such that there are an equivalent number of cases of delayed and non-delayed flights.\n",
    "\n",
    "Encode and Impute: <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "During the encode stage we create our feature vectors and one hot encode all categorical variables. During imputation we assign all null values in numeric columns to the mean value for the column. In the future, we aim to do a lookback on the origin airport, destination airport, or flight for better robustness. During this stage we also rescale all numeric features by subtracting out the mean and dividing by the variance of the column. For categorical features, we either create a \"No Data\" term or assign the most probable option (like \"not holiday\" in the case of the IsHoliday feature). Imputers and scalers were trained on the most recently available training fold for validation folds and the blind validation/test sets. Splitting the data, encoding, and imputing only takes a few minutes, but because that data is later used in several different places, we want to save something for reference, so we checkpoint all of the data after this stage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Model Training and Evaluation: <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "For each model, we performed a Grid Search, during which we iterated through values of hyperparmeters relevant to the model type and trained against each fold, recording the F1 score for the validation and training sets on each. Once this is done, we select the best combination of hyperparameters and take that model and evaluate it against the blind validation data. The model which performed best on the blind validation set was then run against the blind test set to obtain our final metrics.\n",

    "To enhance aviation customer experience, this project built a model predicting flight delays (over 15 minutes) 2 hours prior to scheduled departure using weather, flight, and airport data. We explored data, engineered features, and trained various machine learning models. Hyper parameters were optimized through grid search and validated on unseen data. The best model, identified on a blind validation set, was then evaluated on a blind test set for final performance.\n",

    "# <center>Gap Analysis: Best Pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "This section describes the Gap Analysis to measure how effectively we achieved our project goals by integrating the Gradient-Boosted tree classifier within the machine learning pipeline. To summarize, the primary objective is to maximize the F1 score while predicting whether a flight will be delayed by 15 or more minutes with information available 2 hours before the scheduled departure. Given the performance of the Gradient-Boosted tree presented in the previous sections, there are 3 primary categories we would like to present in this Gap Analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Feature Importance and Selection\n",
    "In the table below, we present the importance score for each feature in the Gradient-Boosted Tree classifier. This score denotes which features have the most influence on our delay prediction response where the highest scores have the most influence. In our selected model for the best pipeline, the scaled weather features (labeled below as \"scaled_numeric_features\") have the most influence in our delay predictions while the departure time slots also score high in importance which is to be expected as demonstrated during the EDA section. However, non-numeric features do not appear to have a high influence on the delay response which needs to be investigated as a potential improvement in the pipeline. For example, we expected the holiday season to have a higher influence on the flight delays and perhaps we need to increase our Holiday Rush window to greater than 2 days so that it spans at least 4 days. This illustrates that there are areas for improvements in our feature engineering efforts to achieve better F1 scores and provide better service to end-users.\n",

    "#### 2. Flights Qualified Incorrectly\n",
    "The confusion matrix below demonstrates the predictive performance of our best pipeline with Gradient-boosted trees on the blind test dataset. From the total number of flights that were delayed, we predicted that approximately 65.55% are delayed based on the Recall metric when testing against the blind test set. While we achieved the lowest possible number of False Negatives, flights predicted as On-Time but result being delayed, we could improve our metrics by performing additional future engineering.\n",

    "#### 3. Scale of Metrics\n",
    "In this project we agreed to maximize the F1 score due to the imbalance of our dataset. Upon future work, we will consider other metrics of success such as F2 scores since this assigns more importance to Recall scores. Being able to scale our data balancing efforts with approaches such as Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE), and apart from undersampling, will also be necessary to consider different metrics of success such as Accuracy and F0.5 scores."

    "As next steps for this project, we recommend the following strategies:\n",
    "\n",
    " - Building an ensemble model: custom built using spark pipelines, there is a potential to combine the predictions from weaker models and reducing the overall variance of the model, in addition ensemble models can also capture complex non-linear relationships between features better when compared to single models. When building the ensemble model pipeline potential for overfitting must be checked, along with use of seasoned developers as ensemble models tend to be more complex compared to single models.\n",
    " - Data augmentation: The current dataset is heavily imbalanced and lacks key features that can improve the prediction performance of the model. We think if the current dataset can be augmented using following datasets it will result in an improved model:\n",
    "\t - Track record of airlines distributed by airport.\n",
    "\t - Pilot and crew data: assessing features like pilot fatigue, and pilot experience.\n",
    "\t - Air-traffic control (ATC) data with features like congestion, and flow rate.\n",
    "\t - Airport security check data: features that provide information around time taken by an average traveller to clear the security line.\n",
    "\t - Operations data: features like ground crew shortages, refueling time, severe weather handling equipment, time taken for operations like de-icing, and maintenance logs.\n",
    "\t - Booking data: features like overbooking.\n",
    "\t - Commercial data: features where route preference information is available, for instance is the system optimized towards higher paying routes.\n"
